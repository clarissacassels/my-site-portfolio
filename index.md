---

As a bilingual professional fluent in English and Italian, with strong academic writing skills in both languages, I bring creativity, precision, and dedication to every project. With a background in conservation and education, I specialize in crafting high-quality content that reflects sustainability, inclusivity, and care.

After earning my Bachelor's in European Studies and Master's in Forest and Nature Conservation in the Netherlands, I spent years working as a teacher, writer, and translator. I run a biodynamic farm in the Italian Alps where I offer personalized language learning experiences in nature for kids of all ages.​


My Strengths & Skills:
- Creative Writing: Inventive and imaginative, I craft engaging, original content tailored to client needs.
- Translation Excellence: High-quality, culturally nuanced translations between English and Italian.
- Academic Precision: Proven experience in academic writing, with a strong foundation in research and structure.
- Timeliness & Professionalism: I am committed to delivering exceptional work on schedule, adapting to client feedback, and working collaboratively toward long-term goals.
  
I am seeking a part-time, long-term project that allows me to channel my creativity and skills into meaningful work. Open to milestones and flexible arrangements, I am ready to bring your vision to life with passion and precision.

Let’s collaborate to create something remarkable!
